Clickweave is an open-source desktop automation platform that combines a visual workflow builder with AI-powered planning and execution. Build automations with drag-and-drop nodes, describe what you want in natural language, or mix both approaches. Clickweave acts as a computer use agent (CUA) — it can see your screen, click, type, and make decisions — while giving you full control over every step.

## Features

### Visual Workflow Builder

A node-based graph editor for designing automation workflows. Add nodes from a categorized palette, connect them with edges, and configure each step through a detail modal with setup, checks, trace, and run history tabs. Supports multi-select, rubber-band selection, undo/redo, and visual loop grouping.

### AI Workflow Planning

Describe your automation goal in natural language and Clickweave generates a complete workflow graph. The planner:
- Converts intent into a sequence of typed nodes using available MCP tool schemas
- Generates deterministic **Tool** steps by default, with optional **AiStep** and **AiTransform** nodes
- Auto-repairs malformed LLM output with one-shot retry and error feedback
- Validates generated workflows against structural graph rules
- Supports lenient parsing — partial corruption doesn't discard the entire response

### AI Workflow Patching & Conversational Assistant

Modify existing workflows through conversation. The assistant panel lets you describe changes in natural language, and Clickweave generates patches that add, remove, or update nodes. Patches are staged for review before applying. The assistant validates patches against the workflow graph and retries with feedback when the result would be invalid.

### Control Flow

Workflows support branching and looping without scripting:
- **If** nodes evaluate conditions and take true/false paths
- **Switch** nodes match against multiple cases with a default fallback
- **Loop** nodes use do-while semantics — the body runs at least once before checking exit criteria
- **EndLoop** nodes jump back to their paired Loop node
- Node outputs are extracted into runtime variables that downstream nodes can reference in conditions

### Computer Use Agent (CUA)

Clickweave sees and interacts with the desktop via [native-devtools-mcp](https://github.com/anthropics/native-devtools-mcp), communicating over the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification):
- **Visual perception:** screenshots, OCR text detection, image template matching
- **Interaction:** mouse clicks, keyboard input, scrolling, window management
- **Smart resolution:** LLM-assisted app-name and element-name resolution with caching and retry

### Post-Run Verification

Attach verification checks to any node:
- **Typed checks:** `TextPresent`, `TextAbsent`, `TemplateFound`, `WindowTitleMatches`
- **Expected outcome:** free-text description of what should happen after the node runs
- **VLM evaluation:** after a workflow completes, a vision-language model examines trace events and a post-execution screenshot against each check
- **Verdicts:** pass, fail, or warn — displayed in a verdict bar with expandable per-node breakdowns and VLM reasoning
- **Failure policy:** each check can be set to `FailNode` (hard stop) or `WarnOnly` (soft warning)

### Run History & Tracing

Every workflow execution is persisted with full traceability:
```
.clickweave/runs/<workflow_name>/<execution_dir>/<node_name>/
  run.json           # Execution metadata and status
  events.jsonl       # Newline-delimited trace events
  artifacts/         # Screenshots, OCR results, template matches
  verdict.json       # Check evaluation results
```
Browse past runs in the UI, inspect trace events, and preview captured artifacts.

### Pluggable AI Backends

Three independently configurable LLM endpoints (set in **Settings**):
- **Planner** — generates and patches workflows
- **Agent** — powers AI step execution during runs
- **VLM** (optional) — dedicated vision model for image analysis and check evaluation

All endpoints use the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` format. Works with local servers (LM Studio, vLLM, Ollama) or hosted providers (OpenRouter, OpenAI). No API key required for local endpoints.

### Local-First & Cross-Platform

Desktop actions run locally. LLM/VLM requests go only to the endpoints you configure (defaults to `localhost`). Built with Tauri v2, producing lightweight native apps for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## How It Works

1. **Describe or build** — Type your automation goal in the planner or drag nodes onto the canvas
2. **Review the graph** — Inspect the generated workflow, tweak node parameters, add checks
3. **Execute** — Clickweave walks the graph node by node, driving tools via MCP
4. **Verify** — Post-run checks evaluate results with VLM-assisted screenshot analysis
5. **Iterate** — Use the assistant to patch workflows conversationally, or edit nodes directly

## Architecture

Clickweave is a Tauri v2 hybrid app with a Rust backend and a React frontend.

## FAQ

### What is Clickweave?
Clickweave is an open-source desktop automation platform that acts as a computer use agent. It combines a visual node-based workflow builder with AI-powered planning and execution for automating UI tasks on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### How does Clickweave automate the desktop?
Clickweave drives desktop interactions through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification) by spawning [native-devtools-mcp](https://github.com/anthropics/native-devtools-mcp) as a subprocess. This provides screenshots, OCR, mouse/keyboard control, and window management — all without injecting code into target applications.

### Does Clickweave require coding?
No. You can build workflows visually with drag-and-drop nodes, use natural-language prompts for AI-assisted planning and patching, or combine both approaches.

### What is a computer use agent (CUA)?
A computer use agent is software that can see and interact with a computer's graphical interface — taking screenshots, reading text via OCR, clicking buttons, and typing — to accomplish tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. Clickweave is a CUA that gives you a visual editor to control what the agent does.

### Which AI model providers does Clickweave support?
Any provider with an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint: LM Studio, vLLM, Ollama (OpenAI-compatible mode), OpenRouter, OpenAI, and others. You can use different models for planning, execution, and vision tasks.

### Is Clickweave local-first? Does it send my data to the cloud?
Yes, Clickweave is local-first. Desktop automation actions run entirely on your machine. LLM/VLM requests are sent only to the endpoints you configure — which default to `localhost`. No telemetry, no cloud dependency.

### How does Clickweave compare to traditional RPA tools?
Traditional RPA tools rely on selectors, DOM scraping, or accessibility APIs tied to specific applications. Clickweave uses visual perception (screenshots + OCR + template matching) and can automate any application with a visible UI. The AI planner means you can describe what you want rather than manually scripting every click.

### Can Clickweave handle conditional logic and loops?
Yes. Clickweave supports If, Switch, and Loop control-flow nodes. Node outputs are extracted into runtime variables that conditions and loops can reference, so workflows can branch and repeat without scripting.

### How does workflow verification work?
You can attach typed checks (TextPresent, TextAbsent, TemplateFound, WindowTitleMatches) and free-text expected outcomes to any node. After a workflow completes, a vision-language model examines trace events and post-execution screenshots to produce pass/fail/warn verdicts for each check.

### What is MCP and why does Clickweave use it?
The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification) is a standard for connecting AI models to external tools. Clickweave uses MCP to decouple its orchestration engine from specific automation backends — the same workflow graph can drive different MCP servers without changing the workflow definition.
